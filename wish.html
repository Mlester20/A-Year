It’s been 18 months since we started our journey together. and yet it still feels like yesterday when we first talked on that day.
Who would've thought that a random match would lead me to someone who'd feel like home?

Since day one, there was something in you—something quiet, but strong—that told me "you’re the one I was meant to find". And now, after all the days, calls, and even our hard times, I’m still here. "Because it’s still you. It’s always you."

Thank you for staying.
Thank you for being my safe place.
And thank you for loving me—even on days I don’t feel like I deserve it.

Happy 18th monthsary, Love.
Here’s to more months, more growth, more memories—and a love that stays, even when it’s not always easy.

There were times we almost gave up—when distance, miscommunication, or the weight of life tried to pull us apart. But we held on. Maybe that’s what love really is—not the perfect fairytale, but the real effort" to understand, forgive, and still choose each other day after day.

You’ve seen me at my best, and even more so at my worst. And yet, you chose to stay. That means everything to me.

I love how we can be goofy together one moment, then deep and vulnerable the next.
I love how you get me in ways others don’t.
And I love how just hearing your voice or seeing your name pop up in a notification can instantly make my day better.

You make love feel safe.
You make forever feel possible.

As we celebrate our 18th, I just want you to know:
No matter how far we are, no matter how busy life gets, I will always make space for you—because you’ve made a home in my heart.

Here's to us—our story, our slow mornings, our late-night calls, our inside jokes, and everything still waiting for us in the future.

I love you. Always.
